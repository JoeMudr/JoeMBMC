# JoeM BMC
Originally called "JoeM BMS" is now called "JoeM BMC" Battery Management Controller. Since it's not a complete BMS but only a controller for existing BMS-Modules.
This is the updated version for Teensy 4.0

This project is derived from [Toms SimpBMS code](https://github.com/Tom-evnut). It started as a clone (Software & Hardware) but ended up completely rewritten and redesigned. But you might still find some traces to the original code.

Complete documentation coming soon. 

Latest Version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/JoeMudr/JoeMBMC/blob/main/Bin).
